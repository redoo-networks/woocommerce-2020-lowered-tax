# Woocommerce temporarily lowered VAT  
German government decided to lower the vat rates for companies from 1st July 2020 until 1st January 2021.  
This plugin will modify tax rates and automatically switch back to 19% in 2021.

It also defines a PHP constant **CURRENT_TAX_RATE**, which can be used to get a fixed value of current tax rate. This can be used in plugins, which generates output dynamically.

You can also copy this code into your plugin to use or modify the function.
